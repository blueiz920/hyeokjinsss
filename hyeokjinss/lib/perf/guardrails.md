# Motion Guardrails

- Only two pinned sections allowed.
- Introduce a short breathing section between pinned sequences.
- Reduce distances and scrub strength when `prefers-reduced-motion` is enabled.
- Maintain keyboard focus flow; anchor navigation should focus the target section.
- Avoid layout shifts during scroll-trigger refreshes by setting min-heights.
